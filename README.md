# AutomatedSravaLeaderboard
Tool to automate the Marianopolis Cycling club's Strava contest.

Very useless. More of a learning experience to test out the selenium library. It originally worked withe the RUnning Club, but it had to be slightl hard-coded. Challeneg now is to full do it in a cool way.
